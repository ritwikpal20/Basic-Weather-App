# Weather App

This app is based on how a server makes request to external server of [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch data , and about setting up API Keys.

## Development on local machine

This requires setting up a .env file ,which may contain private key, passwords,etc as :

```
NODE_ENV= development
API_KEY= *Your API key from OpenWeatherMap *
SECRET_STRING=*Your secret string for encrypting cookies*
```

## For Production

All the environment variables are already set on Heroku
